He pushes his hands into his pockets, nervously.

"Do you still want to be friends? Still...hang out after the class?"

+ "Sure."
    He sighs with relief.
    "Good. Great. {house: ->sex_debrief}
    He scratches his chin.
    "It was really nice talking to you. I know...I did 90% of the talking...but I needed it, and I appreciate you giving that time and space to me, and for not putting yourself out more than you felt comfortable doing."
    
+ "I need to think about it. I hope you understand."->go_end

He nods.

"Cool. Safe journey home."

He avoids your eyes.
"I'm sorry I kind of...came on to you without a lot of warning. I think in the context, it kind of made sense, but, I still put you under pressure, and...I hope you understand why I thought it was appropriate, and...I hope it doesn't change things too much. I can still appreciate you without...'that' aspect of it. But, it's up to you."

+ "It's ok. I get why you did it, I just...didn't feel that way."
    He smiles.
    "No problem. Sometimes you don't know until you're in the moment."
    ->go_end
    
+ "Yeah. I wasn't ok with that."
    He nods.
    "Right. Understood. Sorry."->go_end
