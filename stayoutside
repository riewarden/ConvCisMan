{house: He walks you out to the street.} There's a cool breeze in the air. Toby lingers, again.

+ "I need to go."
    ->go_end
+ "...Everything ok?"
    ->everything_ok

===everything_ok
He pushes his hands into his pockets, nervously.

"Do you still want to be friends? Still...hang out after the class?"

+ "Sure."
    He sighs with relief.
    "Good. Great. 
    {house: ->sex_debrief}
    He scratches his chin.
    "It was really nice talking to you. I know...I did 90% of the talking...but I needed it, and I appreciate you giving that time and space to me, and for not putting yourself out more than you felt comfortable doing."->go_end
    
+ "I need to think about it. I hope you understand."
    ->go_end

===go_end
He nods.

"Cool. Safe journey home."

===sex_debrief
He avoids your eyes.
"I'm sorry I kind of...came on to you without a lot of warning. I think in the context, it kind of made sense, but, I still put you under pressure, and...I hope you understand why I thought it was appropriate, and...I hope it doesn't change things too much. I can still appreciate you without...'that' aspect of it. But, it's up to you."

+ "It's ok. I get why you did it, I just...didn't feel that way."
    He smiles.
    "No problem. Sometimes you don't know until you're in the moment."
    ->go_end
    
+ "Yeah. I wasn't ok with that."
    He nods.
    "Right. Understood. Sorry."->go_end

->END

===blowup
He pauses, breathing heavily.

"I'm sorry. I got so cross there. That was not fair on you."

He puts his hands over his face, and exhales.

"Sorry. I convince myself that I can just...talk about this shit, like it's stupid, and I'm stupid, but I think a lot of it still makes me really angry."

His hands come away from his face.

"Look, I'm going to go home. Sorry to cut this off. Sorry for blowing up like that. Yeah."

He gives you a quick wave, and a nod. Then, he turns, and heads to his house.
