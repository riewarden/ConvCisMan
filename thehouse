You find yourself sitting on the sofa, while Toby moves things around in the kitchen.

The kettle drones. There's a games console under the TV, and a half-finished knitted blanket on a dining room chair. Toby hands you a mug, which is way too hot, and you put it down on the coffee table. He sits back, still holding his, and looking at you.

"First question."

* {flirt}"You call yourself 'gay', don't you?"
->g_s
* (tothepoint){flirt}"When do we start?"
->to_me
* {not flirt}"Am I right in thinking that you describe yourself as 'gay'?
->g_s
* {not flirt}
* ->g_s

He takes a sip of coffee, and nods patiently, like he's explaining Microsoft Word to an elderly relative.

"Yes, yes, that's what we call it. On account of me, being a man, and liking men, and fucking men. {flirt:You're not as bright as I gave you credit for, are you? Imagine getting this far, and only asking now if I would actually fuck you. You must be desperate.|Don't worry, I'm not offended. I can...tell that you mean the same thing as what I'm thinking. Even if you had all of the wrong words."}

* (makingfun)"Are you...making fun of me?"->s_j
* (annoying){flirt}"You're annoyingly attractive when you're taking the piss."->s_j
* (allwrong){not flirt}"Am I doing this all wrong?"->s_j

=s_j
{
-allwrong:He grins at you.
"Of course you aren't. You're trying so hard, and it's adorable."
-annoying:He takes a sip of coffee, and looks at you over the top of it. Then, he sets it down
"Oh, I can do much, much worse than this. And, I think you'd fall over yourself for it."
-makingfun:He looks around, as if there was someone else to accuse of making fun of you.
"Me? Yes!"
}
He looks at you fondly.

=j_s
"God, this is such fun. I just feel like...I know who I am now. I don't have to play this...awful <i>character</i> for the benefit of the other person."

He puts his head on one side.

"Before I transitioned...There was a line from a song..."

+ He pauses to recall it.

- "<i>'I will not cry, I will not think...when I make love, it won't be me'.<i>"

He nods.

"That always stuck in my head, and I thought 'Yep, this is what sex is, forever, and I hate it'. And, given the context of the song..."

He falls quiet. He seems embarrassed. Closed off. 
+ He takes another sip.

-"...Yeah. Not great."

He takes a breath, and exhales slowly. Then, he shakes it off, and smiles at you. 

"I'm ok. I'm here."

{flirt:He puts his hand on your thigh.|He makes a fist and knocks it on your knee.}

"I'm here. Go on. Ask me another. Ask me about my dick, but not my cock."

+ {flirt}"Alright. I'm asking you about your dick."
->j_g
+ (usedick){flirt}"How do you like to use your dick?"
->j_g
+ "What's the difference?"
->j_g
+ (dontund){not flirt}"Sorry, I don't get it."
->j_g
+ {not flirt}"What about your dick?"
->j_g

=j_g
{
-dontund:He smiles.
"Hey. It's okay. I'm discovering that I quite enjoy explaining things to you."
He sits back.
}{usedick:He smiles. "Like this.|"Well, my dick is what I call...this part of me.}" {usedick:He puts his hand down his trousers, and you see his hand moving, slowly, but not around the outline of his cock.|He points to his crotch. "Like, the actual part of my anatomy."}
{usedick:He sighs, but continues talking, as if he's not doing it. "|"Talking about, and using, my dick, isn't a problem for me.} My bits, in general, are great. I mean, they work, they make me feel{usedick:-ah-} fantastic{usedick:..}. What's not to like?"

He {usedick:tips his head back. He lets his mouth fall open for a second, before continuing|folds his arms and shakes his head}.

"You people. You expect us all to say 'Oh god, the pain', and- yeah, like I fucking hate my chest- But my dick?{usedick: Ah, fuck...}"

+ He looks right at you and grins at the look on your face.

- "And, I call it my 'dick', because it's made of the same stuff as yours, just smaller. Look it up. It's grown a little bit since I started testosterone. That was actually one of the first things that happened. Can't exactly make a Facebook post about that though.{flirt: It's even more sensitive than it was before. And, I'm twice as horny.}"

+ {usedick} He withdraws his hand, and wipes it on his jeans.
+ {not usedick}He pulls one knee up to his chest.

- "You don't hear much about t-dicks online, or in the media. Everyone's too interested in phalloplasty or whatever. Which is valid. I, on the other hand, have... options. Which is fun."

* {not flirt} "By 'options', you're talking about-" 
->g_j
* {flirt} "By 'options', you're talking about your cock, aren't you?" 
->g_j

=g_j
{flirt:"Yes. |"-}Some people call it a dildo. I call mine 'my prosthetic', or 'my cock'. I'm wearing it right now."{flirt: He traces the outline of it with his fingertips.}

He smiles.

"It's an everyday piece of equipment for me, like my binder, or my underwear. Or your own cock, to you. I feel weird going around without it."

+ He blows on his coffee, and seems to lose himself in a thought{flirt:, stroking his cock absentmindedly}.

- "And...<>{
- flirt: I've not used it on another person yet. Only for myself. I'll touch my dick for a while, and get myself nice and wet, on my own precum. Then, I put it in position, and turn on the vibe. Then, I can rub it, and feel it on my dick. Now that feels excellent by itself. But then, I start thinking about fucking a guy. {annoying:You said earlier that I was attractive when I was taking the piss. Well. I think I could be even more attractive if I had someone begging for my cock while I was humiliating them.|Giving him my cock, while he writhes and moans for me.}"
- else:Although I haven't had the opportunity to bend a guy over and firmly give it to him... It's nice to know that, should the opportunity present itself, at short notice, I could react accordingly."
}
+ He looks at you, and then laughs darkly at your expression.

- "<>{
- flirt:Do you want to say something?
He's sat close to you. His lips are slightly open. {usedick:His hand, that was touching his dick earlier, is clenching and unclenching.|} 
- else: God, it's all so much easier than it was before.<>
}"
He's looking into your eyes.
+ {not flirt}"How...would you have sex with me? Or, someone...like me?"->to_me
    {~withme = true}
+ (wantyou){flirt}"I want you."
->to_me
+ "I think I'm making a mistake."
->mistake

He looks across at you.

"Is everything ok? I can dial it back."

+ "I think I was genuiunely curious. But, I don't feel about you that way."
+ (hurts)"I think...you're giving me a lot. And, I'm not willing to give the same back."
    
- He nods.
"Ok. Thank you for admitting it. {hurts: I won't lie, that kind of hurts,} but I'm glad you've been honest with me. I can't ask much more."

A silence. He drums his fingers on his knee.

"Alright. Come on. I'll show you out."

+ You follow him to the door->leavehouse
